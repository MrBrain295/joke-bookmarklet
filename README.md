# joke-bookmarklet
A bookmarklet to tell you jokes. To use it (at least for Firefox) right-click your bookmarks bar. Click add new bookmark. Put whaterver you want for the title, I use "joke", then pase the contents of `bookmarklet.js` into the URL feild. Then just click it. NOTE: If it dosen't work its probaly the website that you are on's CSP blocking it.
